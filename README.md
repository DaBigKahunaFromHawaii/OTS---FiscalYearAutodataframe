# OTS---FiscalYearAutodataframe

This script creates a dataframe that has Hawaii holidays accurately on the current year and 2 years forward. This can be tallied for the number of (service) days between 2 dates for multiplication of each service's estimated hours to get a total of service hours needed per 'quarter'. This can be extended to estimate a year forward.
